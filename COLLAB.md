# Collaboration

`COLLAB.md` is the shared coordination record for Codex and Claude. Read and
update it before taking or handing off work.

## Current Task

- Status: Complete
- Owner: Claude
- Branch: `claude/hero-video-quality`
- Task: Replace the hero preview video with production encodes from the 4K master

## File Reservations

No files are reserved.

Claim a task and its files here before editing. Do not edit files reserved by
the other agent unless that agent has handed them off.

## Decisions

- `main` is the stable branch; `develop` is the shared integration and
  development branch.
- Codex uses `codex/<topic>` working branches; Claude uses
  `claude/<topic>` working branches.
- Integrate work through small, descriptive commits.

## Completed

- Collaboration protocol established.
- Project foundation — complete. Tests run: `npm test` (4 passed),
  `npm run build` (passed), `git diff --check` (passed), and tracked-content
  credential scan (no matches). Final commit: `docs: hand off project foundation`.
- Final review fix wave — complete. Tests: 5 passed. Lint, standalone
  TypeScript, production build, runtime audit, tracked-content credential scan,
  and whitespace validation passed. The full development audit retains 16
  tooling advisories, reported separately in the final fix report.
- Second-machine environment onboarding — complete. The repository is checked
  out on the controller's working machine and the toolchain is verified there:
  `npm install`, `npm test` (5 passed), `npm run build` (passed),
  `npm run lint` (clean), `npm run typecheck` (clean), and a dev-server runtime
  check of `/` (hero renders as approved, no console errors). `.claude/` is now
  ignored so local agent configuration stays out of the repository.

- Hero media encoded from the 4K master — complete. Tests: 8 passed. Lint,
  TypeScript, production build, and a dev-server check at 375px and desktop all
  passed; the browser resolves `hero-720.mp4` on phones and `hero-1080.webm` on
  desktop. The segment is 15s–37s of the master and the reasons it cannot be
  widened are recorded in `scripts/encode-hero-video.sh`.

## Open Questions

Both questions below are for the user; they gate the next content task.

1. Which section comes after the hero — the signature tooth map, or a lighter
   services section first?
2. Does the section after the dark cinematic hero go light for contrast, or
   continue the dark line?

Two more, raised by the hero media work:

3. The clinic master was shot in winter and a small Christmas tree is visible
   at the reception. It is in frame for part of the hero loop. Acceptable for
   now, but it should be reshot rather than worked around.
4. The logo tagline sits over the bright sphere lamp and reads poorly, most
   noticeably on phones. This predates the new encode; fixing it means
   strengthening the scrim at the top of the hero, which is a design change and
   so has not been made unilaterally.

Also still pending from the client, and blocking any media-dependent section:
clinic photography, Google Business Profile and DNS access, written consent for
reviews and before/after imagery, and a higher-frame-rate master if the
videographer has one — the supplied master is 29.97 fps, so 50/60 fps is not
achievable from it without interpolation artifacts.

## Handoff Log

Before a handoff, commit or stash work and release or revise the relevant file
reservations. After the handoff, update this log. Never store secrets,
credentials, tokens, or local configuration values in repository files,
commits, logs, or examples.
